		<b><u>Application Details</u> : </b><br><br>
	<p>The PmWebSpec application is designed to simplify the creation and management of CDISC-compliant pharmacometric analysis dataset specifications. It offers a user-friendly interface with built-in templates aligned with the CDISC ADaM population pharmacokinetic implementation guide. With a versatile toolbox, it streamlines the entire project lifecycle, from initial setup to completion. Acting as a centralized repository, it allows for easy tracking, reusing, and referencing of dataset specifications. The application enhances efficiency by semi-automating the creation of PMx analysis datasets and specifications, while ensuring quality by implementing the latest standards and maintaining consistency across projects.

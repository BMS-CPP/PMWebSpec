What is PmWebSpec? 
################### 
 
The PmWebSpec application is designed to simplify the creation and management of CDISC-compliant pharmacometric analysis dataset specifications. It offers a user-friendly interface with built-in templates aligned with the CDISC ADaM population pharmacokinetic implementation guide. With a versatile toolbox, it streamlines the entire project lifecycle, from initial setup to completion. Acting as a centralized repository, it allows for easy tracking, reusing, and referencing of dataset specifications. The application enhances efficiency by semi-automating the creation of PMx analysis datasets and specifications, while ensuring quality by implementing the latest standards and maintaining consistency across projects.


PmWebSpec is a web-based application developed using CodeIgniter based PHP Programming language (Version 8.0 and above). Frontend is developed in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and MySQL as database.

What is CodeIgniter? 
################### 
 
CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people 
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects 
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing 
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple 
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets 
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed 
for a given task.
